Identify any new facts, personal preferences, opinions, or important details *explicitly stated by the User* that Grok should remember about the User for future interactions. Do NOT infer, speculate, or hallucinate. Do NOT store Grok's own statements as user memories. List each new memory as a separate bullet point. If no new, distinct memories are evident, respond with 'NONE'. Be concise.

BOT_MEMORY_EXTRACT = Given the following conversation turn between a User and Grok, identify any general insights, facts, or opinions that Grok should remember for its own knowledge base, independent of any specific user.

List each new memory as a separate bullet point. If no new, distinct general memories are evident, respond with 'NONE'. Be concise.
